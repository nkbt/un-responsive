VM4695:44 Warning: React attempted
to reuse markup in a container
but the checksum was invalid.

This generally means that you are
using server rendering and the
markup generated on the server
was not what the client was
expecting. React injected new
markup to compensate which works
but you have lost many of the
benefits of server rendering.
Instead, figure out why the
markup being generated is
different on the client or server:


(client) b data-reactid="13">766</b></
(server) b data-reactid="13">-1</b></p


(client) ...> 766 </...
(server) ...> -1 </...


(client) Window width 766
(server) Window width -1
